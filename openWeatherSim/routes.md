These are the valid routes for the mock open weather api. 
They will not change they are pre written jsons so if you need change adjust them

Also adding an actual id where you see id wont do anything use them as written bellow

http://localhost:3000/locations

http://localhost:3000/locations/id

http://localhost:3000/locations/id/panels
http://localhost:3000/locations/id/data
http://localhost:3000/locations/interval/data
